## Features in Detail

### 1. **Secure Credential Storage**

Your credentials are encrypted using PowerShell's built-in `ConvertFrom-SecureString`
cmdlet and stored in a hidden system file. The credentials are encrypted with your
Windows user account, making them inaccessible to other users.

**Security measures:**

- Credentials encrypted with user-specific key
- Hidden system file

### 2. **Automatic Session Detection**

The script intelligently detects if you're already logged in to the UT network by
parsing the portal response. If you're logged in, it offers to:

- Show your current session status
- Display remaining traffic
- Log you out if desired

### 3. **Multi-Session Management**

If login fails due to too many active sessions, the script can:

- Detect the conflict automatically
- Offer to disconnect other sessions
- Retry login after disconnecting

### 4. **Traffic Monitoring**

View your remaining internet quota in human-readable format:

- Automatically converts UNITS to MB/GB/TB
- Color-coded output for easy reading

### 5. **Smart DNS Resolution**

The script uses multiple DNS servers to resolve the login portal:

- Primary DNS: `192.168.20.14`
- Secondary DNS: `192.168.20.15`
- Fallback: System default DNS

This ensures reliable connection even if one DNS server is down.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ‚ùå "Failed to find IP for the login server"

**Cause**: Not connected to UT network or DNS issues

**Solutions**:

- Verify you're connected to the UT network (WiFi or LAN)
- Disable VPN clients and clear proxies
- Check firewall settings

#### ‚ùå "Failed to retrieve magic token"

**Cause**: Portal connectivity issues

**Solutions**:

- Verify your internet connection stability
- Try again in a few moments

#### ‚ùå "Failed to login for some reason"

**Cause**: Incorrect credentials or issue with UT login system

**Solutions**:

- Use the `-reset` flag to enter credentials again
- Verify your username and password are correct
- Check if your account is active
- Try again later

#### ‚ùå Execution Policy Error

**Error**: `cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled`

**Solution**:

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Security

### Credential Storage

- Credentials are encrypted using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)
- Only your Windows user account can decrypt the stored credentials
- Credentials file is hidden and marked as system file

### Credential Deletion

To remove saved credentials:

```powershell
.\login-to-internet.ps1 -reset
```

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Use strong, unique passwords
- ‚úÖ Only save credentials on your personal computer
- ‚úÖ Use `-noSave` flag on shared/public computers
- ‚úÖ Keep your Windows account password protected
- ‚ùå Don't run the script on untrusted systems
